# GRC Copilot MVP (Compli-EU)

This project is a compliance automation platform designed for consultants focusing on cybersecurity, focusing on Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) in the European Union. It leverages AI to assist with policy generation, document management, and regulatory knowledge, while always keeping a human expert in the loop for verification.

- **Document Management:** Organize and manage compliance documents and drafts.
- **Regulatory Knowledge Base:** Stay updated with EU regulations like GDPR, NIS2, and more.

- **Client & Project Management:** Manage multiple clients and their compliance needs.
- **Audit Logging:** Track actions for compliance and accountability.
